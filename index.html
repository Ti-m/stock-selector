  <p>Calculate stocks portofilio on given index data like "JOHNSON & JOHNSON,US,Pharmazeutika,1.908490%:JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,US,Banken,1.761526%". The calculator approximates a solution which includes every country and every business sector only once. Furthermore, the calculator searches for the solution including as many stocks as possible. For multiple hits with the same number of stocks, the solution which includes most percentage of the underlying index is favored.</p>
  <p>Lock in console for results with F12;-)</p>
  <p>Improvement Ideas: Add parameter to search for n stocks. Add parameter to allow a country m times. Add parameter to allow a sector k times.
